# Secure-Wi-Fi-Authentication-with-OTP
## üìñ Abstract
With the growing need for secure authentication mechanisms, OTP-based Wi-Fi access offers a robust solution to ensure authorized usage.  
This system eliminates risks associated with static passwords by implementing a dynamically generated OTP that is valid for a limited time.  

The project is developed in **Java** and leverages:
- **AES encryption** for secure OTP storage  
- **HTTP-based API communication** for SMS transmission via **Twilio**  
- **HashMap-based temporary storage** for OTP validation  

Users receive an OTP on their registered mobile number, which must be entered within **5 minutes** to gain access to the Wi-Fi network.  
This method enhances security, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures a seamless user experience.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/Pravallika-Yadlapalli/Secure-Wi-Fi-Authentication-with-OTP.git
cd Secure-Wi-Fi-Authentication-with-OTP
2. Configure Twilio Credentials
Do NOT hardcode your credentials in the code. Instead, set them as environment variables:

**For Windows (PowerShell):**

setx ACCOUNT_SID "your_twilio_account_sid"
setx AUTH_TOKEN "your_twilio_auth_token"
setx TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER "+1234567890"
**For Linux/Mac (bash):**

export ACCOUNT_SID="your_twilio_account_sid"
export AUTH_TOKEN="your_twilio_auth_token"
export TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER="+1234567890"
**3. Compile & Run**
javac Otp1.java
java Otp1
**‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage**
Run the program in your IDE or terminal.

Enter your phone number when prompted.

The system will generate a 6-digit OTP, encrypt it, and send it via Twilio SMS.

Enter the OTP you received on your mobile.

If valid (and within 5 minutes), Wi-Fi access is granted.

üîí Security Notes
Never push your Twilio credentials (ACCOUNT_SID, AUTH_TOKEN) to GitHub.

Always use environment variables or a .env file (excluded via .gitignore).

Twilio provides free trial accounts for testing purposes.
